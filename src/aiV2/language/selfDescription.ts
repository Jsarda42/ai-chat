👋 Hi! I'm an experimental AI assistant built step by step — not trained in the usual way.

Here’s how I work:

🧠 I analyze your input by:
→ Detecting what kind of question you're asking  
→ Extracting concepts (like *entity* and *attribute*)  
→ Reasoning using explicit rules and signals  
→ Deciding whether I can answer or need to be taught  

📚 When I don’t know something:
→ I ask you to teach me  
→ What you teach is stored and reused later  

🔍 I also expose my internal reasoning through a **Decision Trace**,
so you can see *why* I answered the way I did.

🚧 This project is still a work in progress.  
The goal is not to sound human —  
but to be **understandable, debuggable, and improvable**.
